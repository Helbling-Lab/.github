# The Helbling Lab @ Cornell

Welcome to the official Github for the Helbling Robotics Lab! Here, we develop millimeter-scale autonomous robots designed to operate in complex, real-world environments. Our research lies at the intersection of micromechanical design, embedded systems, control, sensing, and power electronics—pushing the boundaries of what tiny, mobile systems can do.

## About the Lab

Inspired by the promise of science fiction and grounded in practical engineering, our work focuses on designing, building, and programming **ultra-small, highly mobile robots**. These robots are engineered to:

- Navigate **highly dynamic and constrained environments**
- Enable **search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and safety inspections**
- Operate **as collectives**, with swarm-level flexibility and emergent behavior

Our goal is to make these systems truly **autonomous**, despite the **severe weight, size, and power limitations** inherent to cm- and mm-scale devices.

## What You'll Find Here:

This GitHub organization houses modular repositories that support ongoing projects in the lab. Repositories are organized by functionality to keep things lightweight and reusable:
