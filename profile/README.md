# The Helbling Lab @ Cornell

Welcome to the official Github for the Helbling Robotics Lab! Here, we develop millimeter-scale autonomous robots designed to operate in complex, real-world environments. Our research lies at the intersection of micromechanical design, embedded systems, control, sensing, and power electronics—pushing the boundaries of what tiny, mobile systems can do.

## About the Lab

Inspired by the promise of science fiction and grounded in practical engineering, our work focuses on designing, building, and programming **ultra-small, highly mobile robots**. These robots are engineered to:

- Navigate **highly dynamic and constrained environments**
- Enable **search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and safety inspections**
- Operate **as collectives**, with swarm-level flexibility and emergent behavior

Our goal is to make these systems truly **autonomous**, despite the **severe weight, size, and power limitations** inherent to cm- and mm-scale devices.

## What You'll Find Here:

This GitHub organization houses modular repositories that support ongoing projects in the lab. Repositories are organized by functionality to keep things lightweight and reusable:
- [ActuatorAnalysis](https://github.com/Helbling-Lab/ActuatorAnalysis): A MatLab script useful for analyzing micro-movements in millimeter-scale actuators.

## Collaborate With Us

We are always excited to collaborate across disciplines—from control theory to hardware prototyping to applied AI. If you're interested in contributing or joining the lab, feel free to [reach out to Professor Helbling](mailto:farrell@cornell.edu) or any of the researchers!
